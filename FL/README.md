# Federated Learning and Deduplication

This folder contains code to analyze the effect of duplicated data in federated learning and use the EP-MPD protocol to securely deduplicate the training datasets held by clients before the federated learning training procedure.

## Installation Instructions

1. Create the environment using anaconda: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate fed_dedup`
3. Install the EP-MPD library: `cd ../EP_MPD && pip install .`
4. Download the datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SYycnxYaLr4iPeMGxGhtxX1Zs8P_UKLI?usp=drive_link) and place them in the `datasets` folder.

## Usage

The FL experiments use `config.py` script to the set the training parameters. The `config.py` script contains is documented with comments next to each parameter. Most of the parameters (learning rate, batch size, model, etc.) are self explanatory and the various options are described in the `config.py` file. We explain some of the important parameters here.

1. `DUPLICATE_RATE`: The duplicate rate sets the percentage of duplicates among the datasets held by the clients. For example, a `DUPLICATE_RATE = 0.3` means that 30% of the data samples held by all clients is repeated more than once.
2. `CLIENTS`: Sets the number of clients for FL training. The chosen dataset is equally divided among the number of clients.
3. `ROUNDS`: Number of FL training rounds to perform in the FedAvg algorithm.
4. `EPOCHS`: Number of epochs of local training a client performs in each training round.
5. `TEST_RATIO`: Ratio of samples in the dataset to hold out for evaluating the perplexity of the trained models. For example, a `TEST_RATIO = 0.2` means that 20% of the data samples in the original dataset are held out for the test data.
6. `USE_EPMPD`: Whether to perform EP-MPD deduplication or not. Setting this to True will override the effects of `DUPLICATE_RATE` as it performs deduplication among the clients before training. If you want to analyze the effects of duplicates in training data on running time and perplexity, always set this to False. 
7. `TYPE`: Type of EP-MPD to use. Can be 1 or 2.

Once the `config.py` folder has configured with the desired parameters, simply run `main.py`. 


## Reproducing the Paper's Results

The logs folder contains all the logs of our experiments along with the associated `config.py` files. These logs can be used to generate Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper. Run `print_stats.py` to generate the data for the tables. To reproduce the results on your own machine, simply use the provided `config.py` files and then run `main.py`.

_Warning: The FL experiments in the paper require a GPU with at least 50GB memory like the RTX A6000 and can take up to 2 days to run._
